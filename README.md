# SenseScape-A-Creative-AI-that-speaks-your-senses-by-Soham-Banerjee-and-Vera-Ezeanya

SenseScape explores the phenomenon of synesthesia by converting words or images into cross-sensory representations—turning colors into sounds, sounds into textures, or words into flavors—using AI to generate immersive multisensory outputs.

SenseScape is a Python project combining machine learning and multisensory data mapping to simulate synesthetic experiences. By inputting text, images, or audio, users receive AI-generated translations into other senses—such as transforming a color palette into musical notes or a sentence into tactile patterns—creating unique sensory artworks and expanding how we perceive information.
